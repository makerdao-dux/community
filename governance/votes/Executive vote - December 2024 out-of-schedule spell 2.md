- **Proposal**: [Forum Post](https://forum.sky.money/t/out-of-schedule-executive-proposal-stability-scope-parameter-changes-19-sfs-dsr-ssr-spark-effective-dai-borrow-rate-spark-liquidity-layer/25648/4)

If this executive proposal passes, then the following savings rate changes will take place:

- Increase the [Dai Savings Rate (DSR)](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.3.2.2.2_Dai_Savings_Rate/8e289e71-7ec5-4ce5-8d4d-41aab7a50f53|57eab733e951) by 3.00 percentage points from 11.50% to **14.50%**.

The Spark Effective DAI Borrow Rate is tied to the DSR. Consequently, the above changes will increase it by ~3 percentage points from ~12.50% to **~15.50%**.
