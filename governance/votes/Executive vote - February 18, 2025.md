## Executive Summary

If this executive proposal passes, out of an abundance of caution, in order to protect the Sky Protocol from potential governance attacks, the following **actions** will occur within the Sky Protocol:
- Risk parameters for LSE-MKR-A will be adjusted as detailed below
- The GSM Pause Delay will be reduced as detailed below

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR/SKY in support of the actions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the actions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2.1_Pause_Delay-a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0|0db30758e055). This means that if this executive proposal passes, the changes and additions listed above will only become active in the Sky Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired. The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to [**30 hours**](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2.1.2_Pause_Delay_Current_Value-09d2514b-3169-4755-a654-2c774456980d|0db30758e055d2d0).

If this executive proposal does not pass within 30 days, then it will expire and can no longer have any effect on the Sky Protocol.
