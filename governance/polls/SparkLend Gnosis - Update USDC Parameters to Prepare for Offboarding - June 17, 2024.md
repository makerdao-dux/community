# Poll: SparkLend Gnosis - Update USDC Parameters to Prepare for Offboarding - June 17, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, June 17 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes to the USDC (Circle USDC) interest rate model on SparkLend Gnosis:

- Reduce optimal utilization by 15% from 95% to **80%**. 
- Increase Slope 2 by 35% from 15% to **50%**. 
- Reduce borrow cap by 7 million USDC from 8 million USDC to **1 million USDC**. 

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/jun-12-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24489) and [analysis by BA Labs](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/jun-12-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24489/2) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to update the USDC (Circle USDC) interest rate model, as described above.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
