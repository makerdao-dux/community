# Poll: SparkLend Gnosis - Turn Off Bridge Security Delay  - May 27, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 27 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes to SparkLend on Gnosis:

- Lower the bridge security delay for SparkLend governance on Gnosis by 2 days from 2 days to **0 days**.
- Set the minimum security delay limit to **0**.

[BA Labs](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/may-21-2024-proposed-changes-to-sparklend-for-upcoming-spell/24327/2) confirms that removing the delay will not impact the risk profile of the Gnosis market.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to lower the bridge security delay for Spark governance to 0 days and to set the minimum security delay limit to 0 on Gnosis.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
