# Poll: Resilience Research Project Application - Legal Opinion on MiCA Compliance for CEX Listings of USDS and DAI - December 30, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Support Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9.1_Operational_Weekly_Cycle-b189fa17-57a9-4d4e-9780-0ce4efd94211%7C0db30308) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, December 30 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to funding a Resilience Research Project proposal which seeks to produce a legal opinion on MiCA compliance for CEX listings of USDS and Dai. The project abstract is as follows:

*As MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation is being implemented across the EU, it is important for the Sky community to clarify the regulatory status of **USDS and DAI** and determine how it can be compliantly listed and offered by centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs). The project aims to obtain a legal opinion regarding the classification of USDS under MiCA and to outline the regulatory requirements for its compliant listing by CEXs.*

*The legal opinion will be published on the governance forum to ensure full transparency and access to the community, as well as centralized exchanges.*

Please review the full [application](https://forum.sky.money/t/resilience-research-project-application-legal-opinion-on-mica-compliance-for-cex-listings-of-usds-and-dai/25759) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Funding will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then funding will be distributed after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2.1_Pause_Delay-a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0%7C0db30758e055) has expired.
