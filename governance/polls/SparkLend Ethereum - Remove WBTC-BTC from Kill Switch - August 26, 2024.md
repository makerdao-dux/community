# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Remove WBTC/BTC from Kill Switch - August 26, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Scope Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, August 26 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to removing the WBTC/BTC kill switch, as it is no longer necessary to prevent additional borrowing in cases where WBTC depegs since new borrowings from accounts with WBTC collateral are not possible.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/aug-23-2024-proposal-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell/24940) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to include this change on SparkLend Ethereum.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
