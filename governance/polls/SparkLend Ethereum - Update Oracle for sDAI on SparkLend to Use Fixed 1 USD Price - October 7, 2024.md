# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Update Oracle for sDAI on SparkLend to Use Fixed 1 USD Price - October 7, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Ecosystem team. This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9_Weekly_Governance_Cycle-95671ce7-60d8-4d8e-b9b6-de7493560308|0db3) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 7 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to updating the oracle for sDAI so that it no longer uses a Chainlink market price for DAI/USD as part of the calculation but instead a fixed 1 USD peg, resulting in the oracle for sDAI calculating the price as follows: `1 USD * sDAI/DAI redemption rate from the sDAI contract`.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.sky.money/t/oct-3-2024-proposed-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell/25293) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option, then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to update the sDAI oracle as described above.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then this change will become active in SparkLend after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2.1_Pause_Delay-a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0|0db30758e055) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
