# Poll: SparkLend Ethereum - Increase Capacity of weETH - July 1, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 1 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows MakerDAO Governance to signal their support or opposition to increasing the capacity of [weETH (Etherfi weETH)](https://app.spark.fi/market-details/1/0xCd5fE23C85820F7B72D0926FC9b05b43E359b7ee) on mainnet with the following parameter changes:

- Increase weETH Supply Cap Max by 150,000 weETH, from 50,000 weETH to **200,000 weETH**
- Increase weETH [Isolation Mode](https://docs.spark.fi/defi-infrastructure/sparklend/spark-lend-features) Debt Ceiling by 150 million DAI, from 50 million DAI to **200 million DAI**

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/jun-27-2024-proposed-changes-to-spark-for-upcoming-spell/24552) for more information about this proposed onboarding.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- The above changes in the capacity of weETH (Etherfi weETH) on SparkLend on mainnet will be added in a future executive vote.
- It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in SparkLend after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
