## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

- Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to reduce WBTC [liquidation threshold](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.3.8.1.6.1.5_Liquidation_Threshold_Definition-9170a423-fba1-4fbe-83c4-f55f2510a9db|57eaf45219be608847d6) on Sparklend Ethereum as described above.
- An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
- It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
- If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.8.2.1_Pause_Delay-a98b8227-95f6-4711-9d8d-f52cbc6ad2d0|0db30758e055) has expired.
