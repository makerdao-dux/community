Phoenix Labs suggests updating these IRMs to more suitable versions that address these issues by reducing the DAI market IRM to the most simple form which tracks the DSR + a hardcoded spread and updating USDC/USDT IRMs to read the DSR directly and adjusting the kink automatically to optimize borrow.
