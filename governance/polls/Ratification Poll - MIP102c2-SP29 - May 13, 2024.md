# Ratification Poll for MIP Amendment Subproposal (MIP102c2-SP29) - May 13, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a ratification poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) as part of the responsibilities defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51). This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for fourteen days beginning on Monday, May 13 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community may vote in this poll to express support or opposition to MIP102c2-SP29 being accepted and implemented in the Maker Protocol.

A brief summary of this proposal has been provided by the MIP Author and is shown below:

*This subproposal aims to clarify for MKR holders their portion of SubDAO tokens, 25%, and the vesting schedule through which they will receive them. No specific technical implementation is prescribed, allowing flexibility in implementation details.*

*MKR holders fund the development of the initial product a SubDAO manages, MKR holders allocate funds or governance powers to the SubDAO, and MKR holders deserve a stake in SubDAOs after bearing that risk and outlay of resources.*

*Simultaneously, the MKR holder vesting schedule is more conservative than the farming emissions schedule, preventing immediate selling by existing MKR holders relative to farmers. The net effect is a marginally slower rate of SuDAO token inflation, because MKR holder vesting pushes some emissions further into the future in an effort to give MKR holders longer-term incentives. This also preserves the original intent for farming rewards to dominate emissions early in the SubDAOâ€™s history, since they follow a halving-style emissions schedule.*
