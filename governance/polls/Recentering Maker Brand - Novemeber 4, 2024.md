# Poll: Recentering Maker Brand - November 4, 2024

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Accessibility Facilitators in accordance with Atlas article [A.5.1.1.3 - Brand Identity - Recentering Maker Brand Polls](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.5.1.1.3_Recentering_Maker_Brand_Polls-133f2ff0-8d73-80ba-add3-d43c59ec407b%7C8d5a16c0e403). This Governance [Poll](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/#A.1.9.1_Operational_Weekly_Cycle-b189fa17-57a9-4d4e-9780-0ce4efd94211|0db30308) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, November 4 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a plurality vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option that you prefer.**
- **If you would accept any of the options you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to either one or none of the following options:

- Option 1 - Keep the Sky brand as the backend protocol brand.
  
  *Description:* Keep the Sky brand as the backend protocol brand. If this option is chosen, no further changes happen and everything remains as today with the brand. The effort to transition MKR to SKY continues, and the Sky brand remains the core brand that both denotes the frontend Sky.money, and the backend Sky Ecosystem and Sky Protocol.
  
- Option 2 - Recenter the Maker brand.
  
  *Description:* Recenter the Maker brand. If this option is chosen, Sky is kept as the brand for the Sky.money frontend, USDS is also kept as the brand for the new stablecoin - but the underlying backend protocol has its name changed to Maker, and MKR becomes the core asset of the protocol. SkyLink becomes MakerLink, SkyChain becomes MakerChain, Sky Token Rewards becomes Star Token Rewards, and Sky Savings Rate becomes USDS Savings Rate. The Maker brand is returned with its old assets, as currently seen on makerdao.com, with minimal change. SKY tokens initially continue to function exactly the same, and SKY Token Rewards would continue at the same rate. Once SPK launches, SKY Token Rewards would be turned off, and the ability to migrate from MKR to SKY would be turned off. However, SKY to MKR migration would remain permanently, with a technical modification to ensure that SKY is backed by a finite amount of MKR, rather than the ability to emit new MKR. The ratio of SKY to MKR will permanently remain 1:24,000. The governance forum would revert to forum.makerdao.com and other similar assets would also revert to Maker branding - with the exception of the main @skyecosystem X handle. What happens to the X handle would be decided in a later process when it is determined what's going to happen with Sky.
  
- Option 3 - Recenter the Maker brand with a limited brand refresh.
  
  *Description:* Recenter the Maker brand, with a limited brand refresh. If this option is chosen, Sky is kept as the brand for the Sky.money frontend, USDS is also kept as the brand for the new stablecoin - but the underlying backend protocol has its name changed to Maker, and MKR becomes the core asset of the protocol. SkyLink becomes MakerLink, SkyChain becomes MakerChain, Sky Token Rewards becomes Star Token Rewards, and Sky Savings Rate becomes USDS Savings Rate. The Maker brand is slightly modified to better align with the USDS brand identity, and to align with its role as the maker of the StarDAOs. The logo font can be slightly refreshed and polished, and the colour scheme and general aesthetic should be inspired by the dark blue / navy “star theme” that can be seen on Sky.money in sections that describe Stars and governance. SKY tokens initially continue to function exactly the same, and SKY Token Rewards would continue at the same rate. Once SPK launches, SKY Token Rewards would be turned off, and the ability to migrate from MKR to SKY would be turned off. However, SKY to MKR migration would remain permanently, with a technical modification to ensure that SKY is backed by a finite amount of MKR, rather than the ability to emit new MKR. The ratio of SKY to MKR will permanently remain 1:24,000. The governance forum would revert to forum.makerdao.com and other similar assets would also revert to Maker branding - with the exception of the main @skyecosystem X handle. What happens to the X handle would be decided in a later process when it is determined what's going to happen with Sky.

**Note that the Governance Portal does not currently support the specified winning criteria (described under **Outcome**) for this poll. However, the winning criteria will still apply at the end of it and the winner will be acknowledged in a subsequent forum post by the Governance Facilitators.**

## Outcomes

**The winning criteria for this poll are as follows:**

- The option with the most votes will be selected as the winning choice.
- However, if Option 1 has the most votes individually, but the combined votes for Options 2 and 3 exceed those for Option 1, Option 2 will be declared the winner.
- The winning option will direct the Maker/Sky workforce, with any required Atlas Edits being presented at a later date.
