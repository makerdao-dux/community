# Poll: Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee - May 23, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, May 23 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following change:
* Launch Maker Teleport with a fee of 1 basis point (0.01%).

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-launch-maker-teleport-with-1-basis-point-fee/15109) to help inform your position before voting.

*Note that the "Maker Teleport" name is a rebranding from the Maker Wormhole, details on that name change can be found [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/maker-wormhole-new-name-maker-teleport/15115).*

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive passes, then this change will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
